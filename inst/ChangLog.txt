Version 1.2
-----------

- a package-vignette was integrated 
- function 'precisionPlot" was added visualizing the relationship between
  C5 and C95 concentrations, (im)precision and one or two cutoffs

Version 1.1
-----------

- fixed issue with 'alpha' not having any effect when being set different from the default in function 'plot.VFP'
- added function 'deriveCx' for derivation of sample-concentration at which a pre-defined proportion of repeated
  measurements would fall above the cutoff, e.g. C5 or C95

Version 1.0
-----------

- initial version put on CRAN
