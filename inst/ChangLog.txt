Version 1.3
-----------

- issue was fixed if input data contained variables with default names but user specified
  different variables, this had no effect because the variables with default names were used
  for the fitting
- condition handler was updated indicating an error if no result is returned by
  package gnm
- multiple issues were reported for model three which did not return a valid result,
  start value procedure for this model was improved 

Version 1.2
-----------

- a package-vignette was integrated 
- function 'precisionPlot" was added visualizing the relationship between
  C5 and C95 concentrations, (im)precision and one or two cutoffs

Version 1.1
-----------

- fixed issue with 'alpha' not having any effect when being set different from the default in function 'plot.VFP'
- added function 'deriveCx' for derivation of sample-concentration at which a pre-defined proportion of repeated
  measurements would fall above the cutoff, e.g. C5 or C95

Version 1.0
-----------

- initial version put on CRAN
